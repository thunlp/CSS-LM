despite the untasteful previous review.

also they were $15 each!
"the service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for."
"my friends spoke so much about it for months, i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in."
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go.
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree.
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.
"if you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!"

somewhat pricey but what the heck.

highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls and spider rolls.
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.
it's convenient.

good food.
"the wait staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient."
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
the dim sum however was very good.
it's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.
service has always been friendly and efficient.
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.
prices are very good.
"we could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us."
fantastic place.
plain and simple it's bad thai food.

"i was a little leary about mary's at first - it's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but i'm glad i finally tried it."
we were not disappointed in the least bit by this little gem.
also very inexpensive.
"we've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner."
i got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.
the food is great and reasonably priced.

the characters really make for an enjoyable experience.
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine!
"over the years the host, vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor."
"the restaurant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accommodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese."

"my husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had."
you cannot go wrong with this place.
"it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner."
"the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment."
prices are in line.
"the combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in ny."
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?
"for all of you new to indian food, try the paneer roll, it is a piece of heaven."
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
both the fresh mozzarella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal.
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.
"the food is terrible and overall, i would have to say avoid at all costs."
"i've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times."
"unfortunately, the food was not something to get worked up about."
"it's constantly open, catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh)."

go inside and you won't want to leave.
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get.
"- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the peter's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad."
"yes, the prices are high, but i felt it was worth it."
"the large selection of bruschetta, panini, tramezzino keep the palate from stagnating."
"have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners."
"while this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burnouts."
the owner truly caters to all your needs.
he takes real pride in his food and his business.

i would go back tho.
"the photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered."
too large for just two people but nothing was left.
i cannot imagine better indian food in all of the city.
great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).
a pleasant surprise.
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
if you don't mind all that noise then go to the chart house.
we got most of it back at home with us.
get there before 7pm.
very good breads as well.
"if this happens, just ask for real naan."
we were fans of the half-price saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit.

"so, if yo really don't care who is sitting next to you, which is about 2 inches away, i would say try it."
"pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta."
definitely a neighborhood favorite.
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value of money.
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.
example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz.
"service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal."
there are other people waiting!
"from beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with raspberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations."
ou must try this restaurant.

consistently good japanese tapas.
no apologies during restaurant week.
"my goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing."
"this place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in nyc (and i'm indian, so i should know)."
they also do a great job for restaurant week.
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently.
"the dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest i've ever had)."
this is where the aforementioned line was.
the food is reliable and the price is moderate.

"aside from the bearded, corduroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, will smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they aren't married yet."

we always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.
i don't how this place is still running.
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.
we were in search of food and stumbled on this block of indian restaurants on east sixth street.
"planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too ."
"very excited to hear that short-term chef jason narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their sterling track record."
excellent experience.
"well worth the trip, close to city hall and downtown subway stops."
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an inattentive.

what more could you want?
"if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat."
"all in all, i don't see how you can go wrong."
the sauce on the pizza is so good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.
"we recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since i had my yorkie with me."
"my husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses."
we were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.
the food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.

"the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, i understood they were busy."
"it's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be."
"food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience)."
"although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy."
"even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk."
"i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good."
it is kinda noisy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.
was surprisingly disappointed.
i love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap.

i went to ruby foo's after work with a group of 6.
i'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet.
"service was prompt, friendly and great."
"i haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgin olive oil."
the sushi was awful!
katz's has been a nyc original for over 100 years.
you can get an excellent meal at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.
"the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience."
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothing on the rest.
"late nite omelettes are not good here, there is no variety!"
everything at sala thai is tasty and well-portioned.
"after all that, they complained to me about the small tip."
it's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.
"behind this counter, two men are squeezed in."
great find!!!
"if only they delivered, they'd make a mint!"
"whenever you need a sushi fix, mizu will be there with quality fish and great service."

"our waitress was sweet and accommodating, not overbearing."
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.
the website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing.

"despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art."
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
"a large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each."
"in any event, this is a place i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town."
i definitely wouldn't go back.
it is not worth for that bucks.
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere.
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.

"for many people, this may not seem like authentic thai food because most places in nyc aren't quite authentic."
"growing up in ny, i have eaten my share of bagels."
"oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!"
a hearty two thumbs up!
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.
"all the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!"
"besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill."

service is top notch.
the food now is inconsistent.
all pretty good.

you guys rock.
chance is a joke.
i was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.

be careful before you request extra spice.
the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad.
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods.
i was at rao's last wed.
and the tom kha soup was pathetic.
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two.
"the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date."
service was quick.
tends to turn people away.
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.
"i was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since."
drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
went there for an office lunch.
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed!
"everytime i decide to try another place on the ues, i get angry that i didn't just go to zucchero pomodori."
the sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasmalai was forgettable.
"we've been following chef lyle's food around new york for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return."
the best thing i tasted were the lambchops.
it's delicious!
the spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had.

been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.
"meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices."
i never had anything i didn't like here.
reasonable prices.
they bring service up a notch by offering complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.
"try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for."
it won't break the bank but i also wouldn't come back for the food.

"all in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city."
i've been to joya twice and i will never go again.
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town.
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects.
"if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side)."
"no refills on fountain drinks, though."
wow over 100 beers to choose from.
be careful of portions - they're huge.
"the steak tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table."
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.

now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.
love pizza 33.
even my indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
"i'm from england, and haru's was the best i had in nyc."
less = more in their case.
ruby foo's is a tourist trap.
i've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.
i've been many time and have never been disappointed.

we won't go to this place again for a good meal.
it's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
"barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance."
we were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!

i wish i lived there as i would eat at this place as often as possible!
"but don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars."
"outstanding bagels, but you get what you pay for."

i have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.
"i found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up."
they even have a section in the menu called american chinese food!

took my sister here before attending a show one evening.
"great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady)."
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
really.
i really loved the different and innovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
our friends have not arrived yet.
they came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.
"i had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good."

never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.
"the food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious."
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish.
"i had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49."
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.
the food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.

"after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations."
wouldn't recommend it for dinner!
sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.
my husband and i enjoy sangria.

we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.

"in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food, this is one of the best spots."
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square.
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.
they don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
other appetizers and food
the noodle and rices dishes taste great.
the food's as good as ever.
"the crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly."
"the crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly."
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw."
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.
the sauces used are also not that exciting.
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
i absolutely love this place!!!
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
"when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occasion of some sort."
"i got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great."

no thanks!!!
"there was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our inside table was very nice."
i would definitely recommend this restaurant.
the prices are wonderfully low.
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.
i love this place!
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.

no free drink.

don't waste money on decor.
they also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and french with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?

try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.
the food portions are really large.
the fries are yummy.
"friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service."
best taiwanese food in ny!
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst.
this place is a great stop for great food.
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city.
what for?
fantastic!
"they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece."

the rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
they used shredded cheese on top!
they are located in the middle of chinatown!

this place is incredibly tiny.
"i will definitely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!"
"i didn't complain, i liked the atmosphere so much."
this is one of our all-time favorite.

made my dining experience uncomfortable.
it's a steal!
we went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments.

"the space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped."
food was average but tasty.
we come from new jersey to eat at kinoko.
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment.
will never be back.
"the entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired."
i highly recommend it.
oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york.

"the pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, i've had better thai food in less aesthetically pleasing places."

pizza was a little soggy.
"the food includes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaat, as well as other great indian appetizers."
the singapore mai fun had no curry flavor whatsoever.
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
the wine list is interesting and has many good values.
murray won't do it.
i'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location.
definite go if you're used to good indian restaurant food from abroad.

too cold to enjoy.

a must for all the dosa lovers.
"the portions are huge, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people."
the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar.
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.
the staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.
"if you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go."
"try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!"
i'm sure i'll return for a final judgment tho.
"of course, it is crowded but who cares."
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list.
i've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
people are always friendly.
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee!!

"it was nice and fresh, but i can't give it high scores on being authentic thai."
"overall, worth every penny."

"got club soda, filled with ice, no lime."
"only wine and beer are served, but the house varieties are actually quite good."
this place must have cost the owners a fortune to build.
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.
i haven't been to the other locations.
"oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!"
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap.

i have to say i have never had a disappointing meal here.
it's one of our favorite places to eat in ny.

this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai (another delicious thai restaurant).
"great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap."
authentic shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york.
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.
perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda.
"that said, i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences i've ever had."
everything about this restaurant was special.

the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
"admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us."
i am a die hard peep lover.
"once you become a regular, you are treated as one."
the menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
everyone treats you like you were part of the family.
the white bean bruschetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats.
the menu is nothing like the one on the website.
"great food, great lay out and awesome service."

ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
sea has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads.
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly.
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city.
"the wait staff is very friendly, they make it feel like you're eating in a friendly little european town."
oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister restaurant arties cafe.
(besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).
my roommate and i love this place.
"the staff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but i've never been dealt with rudely."
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan.

this was on a tuesday night.
its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (i happen to live in inwood).

"this place has the best interior i have seen anywhere in the northside of w'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there."
the food has been consistent for years and it never lets you down.
i found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.
"and forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either."
"don't waste your time, or money!!"
"they don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money."
"we couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down."
sometimes i get good food and ok service.

a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.

went for a late weekday lunch.
i just don't understand all the hype.
bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.
"anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, i wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to tamari."
dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet.
"although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter."
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.
this was my first time at cafe st. bart's and i must say how delicious the food and the service was.
this was my first time at cafe st. bart's and i must say how delicious the food and the service was.
i don't get it either.
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.
great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
"it's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red)."
"one would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so."
one of my favorite places in manhattan.
"they brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table."
"we actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off."

i for one will never patronize them again.
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood.
"after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try."
"the service, however, was a bright flower in a garden."
"so, again, give it a try."
stay far away from this place.
we will come back!!!
we've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.
"the food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special."
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.
tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.
we'd go back again
"we ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there."
the location is perfect.
"guacamole shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the fillet, very good, didn't much like the fries that came with, but the fillet was so good, neither of us cared."
the lunch special is an absolute steal.
this food is asian-air fusion.
nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.

"while i quite liked the food and the ambience, i'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so proudly in the window."
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.
"but on a lazy saturday night, we ended up going."
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience.
"i have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews i got take out last week."
once for dinner and once for brunch.
"i've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square."
not worth the prices.
would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just fantastic.
service was good and food is wonderful.

"being a fan of spicy ethnic foods, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago."
please save yourself the frustration.
and i say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.

"we were on our way back to nj, and since i am in ny, we figured why not grab some food?"
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
and comparing it to the chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.
service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money.

the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
"if presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works."
"apparently, the good cook works then."
i was pleasantly suprised.
the yellowtail was particularly good as well.
one less manhattanite the better.
everyone is welcomed in as family.
i ate clams oreganata and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil.
"the menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor."

"bill a little high, but worth it."
"i seriously doubt i will ever dine at jimmy's bronx, or for that matter, jimmy's uptown, again."
everyone i bring here always loves it.
"my co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered."
worth a visit.
a real disappointment.
its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests.
why do people rave about the ambience.
were meeting up with some friends for a drink at lafayette 161 and happened to walk by thai angel famished.
"fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness."
great sushi experience.
"if you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to del frisco's!"

they charge $6.00 for rice.
my steak au poivre was one of the worst i've had.
"on a recent sunday afternoon, a friend and i accidentally found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt."
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.

"perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull."
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened.
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.

they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.
"to celebrate a birthday, three of us went to mare anticipating great food."
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!
i really liked the noodle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish.
"i went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it."
"but for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high."
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bagel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overrated and on the pricey side.

the staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.
great staff.

the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well.

just an odd group.
"the service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli, italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night."
"either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th."
it is not consistent.
but that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had.

"at 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong."
but the pizza is way to expensive.
"and the staff is also young, energetic and hot!"
"even better, they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it."
"service was decent, but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices and reputation."

"it's charmingly small and that leads to an atmosphere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even."
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine.
"in terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers."
love the jazz bands on fri and sat.
"overall, excellent restaurant!"
"to begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready."
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly i might add).
the service was ok.
"when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not mcdonald's, every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude."

the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
but too far east!
satisfying.
highly highly highly recommended!
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.
we took advantage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation.
"this place is cool enough to be in the east village, but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris."
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.
"the staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces."
this is the best shabu-shabu restaurant in the try-state area.
"no dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy midtown."
"largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!"
even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in new york pizza restaurants).

this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv.
now if they could only get a toaster.
you will find yourself returning quite often.

i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
i must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view.
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.
"just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there."
no gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.

both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations).
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone.
i've been eating at taj mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the indian eateries on this block of indian restaurants.
"night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience."
try the green curry!!!
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
"you rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (massaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it."

"at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous."
it just wasn't thai.
i have enjoyed everything i have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.

"when we sat, we got great and fast service."
"most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive."
i think locals rate this place so high.
service is average.
but they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).
go girls!!!
"they forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter."
"the steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great."
"for asian fusion, there are many places further downtown."

will have to return to try the chocolate!
"it's only $1.95 for a regular slice and $4.00 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms."

i have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn.
the miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.
"everytime my husband and i go there, we are never disappointed."
they are the best bagels i've had.
we were not disappointed.
i've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not new yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food.

"some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order."
the specials are usually quite good too.
they've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods.
try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.
that's good and bad.
really cool staff inside.

"only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel."
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
bring your appetites.
"the wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way)."
"of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?"
service was very good and warm.
for dinner i had the chicken tikka masala and some garlic naan.
cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc.

"also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling."
the food is nothing like its menu description.
try the pad see ew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.
it's just o.k. pizza.
i loved it and would highly recommend.
i've been here twice now.
"the food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, i thought it was just annoying."

the food is above average for midtown and slightly better than some of the other heartland breweries in the city.
this is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu.
the food was absolutely horrible!
food doesn't appear to be cooked on premises but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh.
restaurant was dirty and unkempt.
nice place though.
warning: you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu!

the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy!
we've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?
drinks way over priced.
the main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
what i didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.
"but warning: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations."
moderate prices.
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night.

simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and thats why i checked it out.

"i've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times, but more often i order delivery."
we didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
beautiful experience.
the bagels are also reasonably priced for nyc.

"oh yes, and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, i would love to know where they obtained."

we were then shooed inside.
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.
"it might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can counteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand."
this place is always very crowded and popular.
appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.
really depends on your luck!
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.
my wife and i went to orsay for valentine's dinner.
"i don't know about you guys, but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere."
"they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips, good but a far cry from what the name implies."
"a gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order."
very different than regular dimsum places.
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaurants.
"when you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen."
"we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers."
i've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too.
and when i visit her i make it a point to eat at 'ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip.
"i wasn't there for the half-price saturday night special, but tuesday night."
"in fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment."
there was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at pastis.
for meatball night.
"if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you."
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restaurant and banquet hall and another one in parsippany new jersey.
want to impress?
the selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available.
we've lived in the area for more than 8 years.
get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.

"i have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a seat, a lunch i don't mind."
my family and i ate here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town.
i grew up on these bagels.
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.
the restaurant is very small so reservations are a must.
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.
a one women show!
you can't go wrong here.
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues.
"to my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six."
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.
after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood - i've found little toninos.
i thought this place was totally overrated.
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.
you won't find that anywhere in manhattan.
how do you rate home?
i went here in the afternoon with a friend.
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 10:15.
interior was so so.
i'm partial to the gnocchi.
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies.
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion.
boy was i wrong!
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke.
"note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own."
we ate outside at haru's sake bar because haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.
ahhh.
"better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion."
it helps if you know what to order.
"the service was typical short-order, dinner type."
"we shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while i had the sashimi."
i can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?
but that is highly forgivable.
"from the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food."
"when we arrived at 6:00 pm, the restaurant was practically empty."
"each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles."
i am going to the mid town location next.
chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.

"the food is very average...the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here."
"the decor is night tho...but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern."
food-awesome.
service- friendly and attentive.
ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
the food is decent.
"i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check."
"well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience."
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.
"it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery."
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
quite simply it's like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.
"i like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing."
"the service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not."
"the food was average to above-average; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way."
the combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.
"the signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese."

"not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!"
i'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll.. .
tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.
try their chef's specials-- they are to die for.
"the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no..."
"then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes."
such a disappointment...

the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.
"two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu."
"he served me an uni hand roll, which i never had before, and let me tell you...it was heaven!"
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
"to sum it up: service varies from good to mediocre, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average ok."
"seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening."
the restaurant is cute but not upscale.
"the have over 100 different beers to offer their guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini."
"the have over 100 different beers to offer their guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini."
i have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.
all the staff is absolutely professional!!
"(that is a must, but not every restaurant can do...)"
okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
"it's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor."

"the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy."
"i have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu."
enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.
and where does patis go wrong; no where.
"you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: cassuolet, steake fritte, tripe stew, etc; simple stuff."
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).
mmmmm... it was delicious.
the sushi is amazing!!!
and amazingly cheap.
the pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really made this place was the backyard dining area.

"they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it."
check this place out!
"first of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by citysearch's editorial review."
"for instance, plates were just dumped on the table, i was handed the wine list upside down, etc...."
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
one of us actually liked the espresso - that's it.
myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.
the view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderful.

my boyfriend had prime rib it was good .
we didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough.
it's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!!
all in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few weeks!!!!
the food is amazing... especially if you get the chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.

everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.
"when you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices."
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu.
i was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
"whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite."

"don't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections."
10
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.
"limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice."
"the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish."
the waitstaffs are nice though.
"both times i was extremely disappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude."
"i had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was."
this restaurant is vegetarian; there are no meat dishes whatsoever.
lloovve this place.
waitstaff are very friendly.
"the large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating."
"(the asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)"
wine list is extensive without being over-priced.
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded.
"after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: where are you from...maybe you don't know how things work in america...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on."
"we did tip, i guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager."
"when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not mcdonald's, every place makes things differently"
"while it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude."
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.

it was $14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-i've had better for less elsewhere!
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.
we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial.
she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food.

"guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the fillet, very good, didn't much like the fries that came with, but the fillet was so good, neither of us cared."
the menu has so many fish items and oysters.
"the fish was really,really fresh."
we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york.
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy.
"while their kitchen food is delicious, their sushi is out of this world."
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!
authentic taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatoes.
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice.

awesome pizza especially the margheritta slice.
"try the pad thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious."
i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)
it is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat.
"you can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (i recommend the vanilla shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music."

these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
i was pleasantly surprised.
"the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily."
i really loved the different and innovated touch that's the chef gives to the food.

the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.
have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once.
delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.
delivery guy sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.
best. sushi. ever.
this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi.
"creative, consistent, fresh."
"excellent sashimi, and the millennium roll is beyond delicious."
not cheap but very yummy.
love it.
"very, very nice"

"place is open till late, no dress code."
good food: my favorite is the seafood spaghetti.
highly recommended!
excellent food for great prices
my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit.
the wait staff is very courteous and accommodating.
"the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food."

its alright
"im not necessarily fanatical about this place, but it was a fun time for low prices."
"lobster was good, nothing spectacular."
"its just a fun place to go, not a five star restaurant."
way below average
i think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.
had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.

the service was quick and friendly.
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.
i thought the restaurant was nice and clean.

i ordered the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed.
the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.
the potato balls were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.
the only downside... they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time.
i'll be back for sure.
worst place on smith street in brooklyn
"very immature bartender, didn't know how to make specific drinks, service was so slow, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and weren't very attentive to all the customers."

food was luke warm.
the waitress was not attentive at all.
i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they don't have.
"not because you are ""the four seasons""... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romantic dinner."

"the dancing, white river and millenium rolls are musts."
so good
i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place ...)
gross food – wow-
i can't remember the last time i had such gross food in new york.
my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.
and $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
"don't get me started on the margaritas, either."
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.
save your money and your time and go somewhere else.
"oh, and i never write reviews--i just was so moved by how bad this place was, i felt it was my duty to spread the word."
great indian food!
when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly.

this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york.
"what really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected."
"all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted."

got a date? go here!
every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else.
it is so romantic.
"its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go."
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.
i've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (i'm a daring eater but not that daring).
once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!

"nevertheless, i finished my plate, and that's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom."
"i showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for)."
"when the bill came, nothing was comped, so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but i didn't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it."
"the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession."
we paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.

i've had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers.

vanison was good but not amazing.
bison was quite excellent however.
dessert: pure disaster.
just not good at all.
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all.
"i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself, but may be it is worth it."
"the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ""i've been to the four seasons restaurant""."

terrible waste of money.. scammers
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience!
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
"our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!"
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
the place is beautiful!
the hostess was very pleasant.
"however, our $14 drinks were were horrible!"
"once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!"
our experience did not ever get any better.
for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka.
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.
we asked for beverages and never received them.
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
i would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka!
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
to top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.

the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.
"there was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment."
"not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with brahma."

"she replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."""
the food arrived in about 15 minutes.
i had the thai style fried sea bass...which was very good.
"everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi, seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice!"
i heard the lobster roll was excellent.
"they seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand)."
"all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh."
"service not the friendliest to our ""large party""!"
probably would not go back here.

"my girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant."

the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date.
more williamsburg garbage
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.
"the bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling."
too bad i had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
the nakgi-bokum was horrible.
easily the worst stir-fried squid i've ever tasted.
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean.
"the side dishes were passable, and i did get a refill upon request."
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service.
she just nodded and walked off.
"as to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made."
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
we were charged full price.
lives up to the hype
we've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.
it was well worth the wait.
the wife had the risotto which was amazing.
"it doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal."
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
i love margherita pizza – i love east village pizza

"love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go."
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza.
"the crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components."
"personally i like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good."
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city
"this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!"

"if you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!)."
it’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!

"my party had the bbe $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!"
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
"i picked the grilled black cod as my entree, which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better."
the sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
"for desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal."
"maybe it was the great company (i had friends visiting from philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but i just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie."
"i don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but i’ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner."
"i don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but i’ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner."
terrible would be a compliment!
"the service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night."
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!
we never ate because by close to 2 in the morning we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.
"they are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!"

great shabu shabu
i tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.
"but for the shabu shabu, you won't find much better in ny."
"the meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too."
"the meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too."
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
"the hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun."
restaurant with a view
the food tasted very good.
the family seafood entree was very good.
the main entree was also very good.
"price is high but the food is good, so i would come back again."
"price is high but the food is good, so i would come back again."
this place doesn't make any sense
just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.

this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.

dumbfoundingly poor
"this was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience."
lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn.
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
polite acknowledgment is out;
supercilious scorn is in.
"and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?"
"a different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious)."

i honestly don't even know where to begin.
"we arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy."
everything was going good until we got our meals.

i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled.
"it was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes."
"i took one bite from the $24 salmon, and i have never, in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in flatbush farms."
"at this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress walked away."
"so, i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it."
i couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
"guess what, i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, i wish you would have said something earlier"" no apology, nothing."
"after that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"no desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!"
"this is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and i cannot comp it."
"again, no apology, no is there anything else i can get you, no can i get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!"
the level of rudeness was preposterous.
"the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out."

it was really good pizza.

you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.

"i'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty."
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place.
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
well...they can run but they can't hide.
this place...god where do i begin.
it is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come!!!!

the frizzy retro girl (with winged/ dame edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.
"i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she ""had a bbq to go to"" that night - wtf??"
i'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
"there's another girl who i can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about."
"i'm a friendly person, so i wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal."
"again, i'd be super upset if that were my employee."
"considering you will spend at least $60 a head, i expect better service."

"this guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including paris, that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant."
"his response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening."
"a word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-d's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."
"if you go here, do it on his off-night."
best meal in a long time!
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening.
i had the lamb special which was perfect.

"cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night."
poor service and management
don’t go to this place!
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner.
appetizers took nearly an hour.
when the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
never got an explanation as to what was going on.
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
"when we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing."
"on the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues."
can’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.

expensive
"the bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty."
"the pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor."
so rude!!!
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane.
"i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can i help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
we didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem.
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
bad staff
i generally like this place.
the food is good.
the design of the space is good.
but the service is horrid!
"i was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter."
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
"i can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!"
"the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so i try to ignore it)."
"i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table."
"she then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables."
"i wish i could like this place more, and i wish someone would retrain the staff."
