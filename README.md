## Overview

![CSS-LM](https://github.com/thunlp/CSS-LM/blob/main/CSS-LM.jpg)
CSS-LM improves the fine-tuning phase of PLMs via contrastive semi-supervised learning. Specifically, given a specific task, we retrieve positive and negative instances from large-scale unlabeled corpora according to their domain-level and class-level semantic relatedness to the task. By performing contrastive semi-supervised learning on both the retrieved unlabeled and original labeled instances, CSS-LM can help PLMs capture crucial task-related semantic features and achieve better performance in low-resource scenarios.

## Setups
- python>=3.6


## Requirements 
```
pip install -r requirement.sh
```

<!--
```
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/apex.git
cd apex
pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir ./
```
-->


## Prepare the data
```
wget https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/690e78d324ee44068857/?dl=1
mv 'index.html?dl=1' download.zip
unzip download.zip download

scp -r download/opendomain_finetune_noword_10000 data
scp -r download/openwebtext data
scp -r download/roberta-base-768 script
scp -r download/bert-base-768 script
```

## Run CSS-LM

By executing run1.sh, the code will automatically create folders for the corresponding datasets to save the checkpoints.
```
cd script
bash run1.sh
```
(You can refer to run1.sh for more details.)
